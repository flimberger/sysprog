Coding conventions
==================

Group includes like this, ordered alphabetically:
#include <sys/types.h> /* system includes */

#include <stdlib.h> /* standard library includes */

#include "defs.h" /* project local includes */

#include "file.h" /* header for current file */

Use local include files in the submodules, these include src/sp.mak after the
definition of relative paths to ROOT and the include and library paths (INCP
and LIBP). sp.mak contains all important settings for the compiler etc.
